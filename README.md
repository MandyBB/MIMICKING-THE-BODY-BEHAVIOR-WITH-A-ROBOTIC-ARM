# MIMICKING-THE-BODY-BEHAVIOR-WITH-A-ROBOTIC-ARM
This study designs and develops all the useful components of a bionic arm robot. The core technologies are MyoWareâ„¢ Muscle sensors, Nextion display, ESP8266 microcontrollers and a robotic arm with six degrees of freedom. There is also a Wifi communication between subsystems and a man-machine interface will be designed to be able to drive a robotic arm. To do the acquisition of the human arm signals, it will be used electromyography technology and the Nextion display to interact with the robotic arm in real-time. The validity of a virtual simulation will be also studied.
